📌 Project Objective
Design and implement a real-time attention and distraction detection system that analyzes live webcam video to estimate a user’s focus level during screen-based activities.

The system should combine object detection and facial behavior analysis to identify common distraction patterns—such as mobile phone usage, looking away from the screen, excessive blinking, and face absence—and compute a dynamic focus score along with a focused/distracted status.

The primary goal is to build an interpretable, efficient, and real-time computer vision solution suitable for academic demonstrations, productivity monitoring, and human–computer interaction research.
